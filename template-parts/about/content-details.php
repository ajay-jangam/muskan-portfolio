                I am a designer who approaches design like creating
                the perfect recipe. Just like in cooking, I mix
                creativity, strategy, and a dash of intuition to
                craft digital experiences that feel just right! From
                fintech and agri-tech to SaaS and B2C products,
                every project is a new dish, blending user needs
                with business goals to create something innovative.
            </p>
            <p class="details__description">
                When I’m not designing, you’ll find me experimenting
                in the kitchen, decorating my space, painting
                canvases, or on the road taking long scenic drives.
                I’m also a nature enthusiast, always capturing the
                beauty of the world through my camera. These
                passions keep my creativity alive and deeply
                influence my design process.
            </p>
            <p class="details__description">
                Design, to me, is more than just how something
                looks, it’s how it makes you feel, much like how the
                right meal brings comfort. Whether it's in a UX of
                an app’s navigation or the smallest UI detail, I
                believe every element should feel intuitive and
                personal, like a space you want to keep coming back
                to.
